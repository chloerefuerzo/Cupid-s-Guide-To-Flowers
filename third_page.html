<center><img src="ROSE.jpg" width="600"> <p></p><h1>Rose</h1><h3><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Roses were associated with Aphrodite (Venus), the goddess of love. According to legend,
<br>
when her lover Adonis was wounded, her tears mixed with his blood and gave birth to the red
<br>
rose. In medieval times, the rose was linked to the Virgin Mary, symbolizing love and purity.
<br>
Poets like Shakespeare and writers throughout history have used roses as
<br>
metaphors for love, beauty, and passion. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, 
<br>
Shakespeare wrote:
“A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”</h3></p></center>

<br>
love. Tulips have a graceful, heart-shaped bloom when fully opened, 
<br>
which subtly represents love and passion. Their elegant, soft
<br>
 petals and bright colors make them an ideal flower for expressing romance.</h3></p></center>
<br>
<center><img src="ORCHIDS.jpg" width="600"> <p></p><h1>Orchids</h1><h3><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The word "orchid" comes from the Greek word Orchis, and ancient Greeks  
<br>
associated it with fertility, love, and virility. Orchids have a unique, delicate, and long-lasting beauty, symbolizing 
<br>
refined love and passion. Their symmetrical petals and striking colors make them a flower of 
<br>
luxury, romance, and rare affection—ideal for expressing deep emotions. </h3></p></center>

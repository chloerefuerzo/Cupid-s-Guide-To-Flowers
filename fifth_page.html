<center><img src="C:\GRADE9\YELLOWCARNATION.jpg" width="600"> <p></p><h1>Yellow Carnation</h1><h3><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In Victorian flower language (floriography), yellow carnations were used to say “I reject you” 
<br>
or “I am disappointed in you.” If given in a romantic relationship, they can unintentionally suggest lack of 
<br>
feelings or dissatisfaction. Unlike red or pink carnations (which symbolize love and admiration), yellow carnations are 
<br>
linked to gloom, regret, and jealousy. They were historically sent to decline a romantic confession.</p></h3></center>
<br>
<center><img src="C:\GRADE9\PETUNIA.jpg" width="600"> <p></p><h1>Petunia</h1><h3><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In floriography (the language of flowers), petunias are linked to frustration, 
<br>
resentment, and even hostility—definitely not emotions you’d want to express to someone special. 
<br>
If given in the wrong context, they could be misinterpreted as a sign of conflict rather than affection.</p></h3></center><p></p>
<br>
<center><img src="C:\GRADE9\CHRYSANTHEMUM.jpg" width="600"> <p></p><h1>Yellow Chrysanthemums</h1><h3><p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In floriography, yellow chrysanthemums represent one-sided love or heartbreak.
<br>
Giving them to a romantic partner could unintentionally suggest that feelings are not mutual or that there is 
<br>
distance in the relationship. Unlike red or pink flowers, which symbolize love and affection, yellow 
<br>
chrysanthemums could be seen as a farewell flower rather than a loving gesture.</p></h3></center><p></p>
